1. What are the main HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs, and when would you use each?

  GET: Retrieve data (no changes to the server).
  POST: Create a new resource.
  PUT: Fully update an existing resource.
  PATCH: Partially update an existing resource.
  DELETE: Remove a resource.

2. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

   Example: Updating a user's name in a system.

    a) PUT:
        Scenario: You want to replace the entire user's information.
        
        Request:
        Before: { "name": "John", "age": 30 }
        PUT /users/1 with { "name": "Mike", "age": 30 }
        Result: The user's info is fully replaced, even though you didn't change the age. The server will now have: { "name": "Mike", "age": 30 }

        NOTE:You can also do, PUT /users/1 with { "name": "Rachana", "age": 25}
        
    b) PATCH:
        Scenario: You want to only change the name of the user, without affecting their age.
        
        Request:
        Before: { "name": "John", "age": 30 }
        PATCH /users/1 with { "name": "Mike" }
        Result: Only the name is updated. The user's info will now be: { "name": "Mike", "age": 30 }

Simple Difference:
PUT: You send all the data and replace the whole resource.
PATCH: You send only the data you want to change (like just the name).
